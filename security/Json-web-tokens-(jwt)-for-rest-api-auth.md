#Json web tokens (jwt) for rest api auth

JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Stateless authentication scheme based on RFC 7519 has been recommended as an alternative to OAuth1/OAuth2 for RESTful APIs.

Researching authentication schemes for a RESTful API written in PHP using the Lumen framework, I came across JWT.  This scheme seems easy to implement and should be secure enough for server-to-server use.
