I first heard about the concept of a Today I Learned repository on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902) where user [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) presented his repository with a year's worth of daily TILs.  

In a nutshell, a TIL is a repository of little notes of interesting things you learn.

After looking through his repository, I became enamored with the idea.  Doing what most programmers do, I [built a tool](http://patricklee.nyc/today-i-learned/) to make it easier to take these notes down.  In conjunction with that, I've become very interested in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the platform this site is hosted on.  It is a tiny tool that compiles markdown formatted documents into html pages very easily.  My tool compiles the TILs into Jekyll posts which allows publishing via the Jekyll platform.
